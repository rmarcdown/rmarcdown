### Hi, I'm Marc 👋. Thanks for stopping by!
I'm a data analyst and sports nerd. I love [MJ Lenderman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAjxSzCw7NE), cooking, reading, and making creative sports data visualizations. 

My favorite teams include the Memphis Grizzlies 🐻, the Memphis Tigers 🐅, and Southampton FC 👼.

I am inspired by Owen Phillips and [his blog F5](https://thef5.substack.com), by [Lev Akabas](https://x.com/levakabas?lang=en), and of course by the god of sports data viz, [Todd Whitehead aka CrumpledJumper](https://x.com/CrumpledJumper).
